Create a repository structure that includes both a backend built with C# with net8. 

Please ensure the following:

1. **Root Directory**:
    - `README.md`: A comprehensive readme file with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project.
    - `.gitignore`: A `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the repository.   

2. **Backend Directory (`/back`)**:
    - This directory will house the backend code built with C# with net8.


Please note that it is not required to include content or initialize the backend directories. 

Focus on the overall repository structure and ensure it follows best practices for organization
