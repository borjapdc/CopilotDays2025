Your goal is generate a backend using C# and Net8 that adheres to RESTful API best practices. The API should include CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a sample resource (e.g., 'users'). Please ensure the following:

The database is SQL.

It should listen using the port 4000

Use NET8 syntax.

Structure the project with a clear separation of concerns for clean arquitecture.

Implement input validation and error handling.

Use environment variables for configuration (e.g., database connection strings).

Include comments to explain the code.

Provide basic documentation on how to run the project and use the API endpoints.

Don't forget to install all dependencies you need

Do not include views as part of the project. The frontend will be in a different project

Add a client.http file with the CRUD operations using REST Client extension

Don't forget to include the .gitignore for a Node.js app
